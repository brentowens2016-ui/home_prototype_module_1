1. Introduction
Welcome to Home Prototype Module 1! This guide will walk you through installing, configuring, and using your smart home platform, including device onboarding, AI training, and automation.

2. System Requirements
- Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- Rust toolchain (for advanced users)
- Internet connection (for updates and remote features)

3. Download & Installation
A. Download
- Visit the project’s GitHub or official website.
- Download the latest release ZIP or clone the repository.

B. Extract & Prepare
- Extract the ZIP to your desired folder (e.g., C:\HomePrototype).
- Open a terminal or command prompt in this folder.

C. Python Environment
- (Recommended) Create a virtual environment:
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate (Windows) or source venv/bin/activate (macOS/Linux)
- Install Python dependencies:
  pip install -r python_wrapper/requirements.txt

D. Rust Device Logic (optional, for advanced users)
- Install Rust: https://rustup.rs/
- Build Rust extension:
  cd rust_smart_bulbs
  maturin develop --release

E. Dashboard (React UI)
- cd dashboard
- npm install
- npm run dev

F. Start the API
- cd python_wrapper
- uvicorn api:app --reload

4. Initial Setup & Configuration
- Access the dashboard at http://localhost:5173
- Log in or create an admin user (if prompted)
- Configure your home layout and device mapping via the dashboard or by editing python_wrapper/device_mapping.json
- Validate mapping using the dashboard or API

5. Device Onboarding & Integration
A. Supported Devices
- Zigbee (via Zigbee2MQTT or compatible hub)
- Kasa (TP-Link)
- Home Assistant-compatible devices

B. Adding Devices
- Use the dashboard’s device onboarding wizard
- For Zigbee: Pair devices using your Zigbee hub, then scan in the dashboard
- For Kasa: Ensure devices are on the same network, then scan/add in dashboard
- For Home Assistant: Use the integration menu to link your Home Assistant instance

C. Device Mapping
- Assign names, locations, and types to each device
- Use Alexa-style names (e.g., “Living Room 1”)

6. AI Training Templates & Usage
A. Creating Scenarios
- Use provided templates in python_wrapper/automation_templates.json
- Example template:
  {
    "name": "Night Light",
    "trigger": "motion_detected",
    "action": "turn_on",
    "device": "Hallway Light"
  }
- Edit or create new templates for custom automations

B. Training the AI
- Use the dashboard’s AI training section
- Upload or edit scenario templates
- Test automations in the dashboard

7. Dashboard & Controls
- Control devices, view status, and manage automations from the dashboard
- Access analytics, system health, and event history
- Use the mapping and automation editors for advanced configuration

8. Automation & Rules
- Create, edit, and delete automation rules in the dashboard
- Use templates or build custom rules
- Validate and test automations before enabling

9. Backup, Restore, and Updates
- Use the dashboard or API endpoints to create/restore backups
- Upload OTA updates via the dashboard or /ota API
- Regularly back up your configuration and device mapping

10. Troubleshooting & Support
- Check the dashboard’s diagnostics section for errors
- Use the /diagnostics API for logs and health checks
- For support, see the support section in the dashboard or contact the project maintainers

11. Recommended Devices
