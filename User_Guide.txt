1. Introduction
Welcome to Home Prototype Module 1! This guide will walk you through installing, configuring, and using your smart home platform, including device onboarding, AI training, and automation.

2. System Requirements
- Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- Rust toolchain (for advanced users)
- Internet connection (for updates and remote features)

3. Download & Installation
A. Download
- Visit the project’s GitHub or official website.
- Download the latest release ZIP or clone the repository.

B. Extract & Prepare
- Extract the ZIP to your desired folder (e.g., C:\HomePrototype).
- Open a terminal or command prompt in this folder.

C. Python Environment
- (Recommended) Create a virtual environment:
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate (Windows) or source venv/bin/activate (macOS/Linux)
- Install Python dependencies:
  pip install -r python_wrapper/requirements.txt

D. Rust Device Logic (optional, for advanced users)
- Install Rust: https://rustup.rs/
- Build Rust extension:
  cd rust_smart_bulbs
  maturin develop --release

E. Dashboard (React UI)
- cd dashboard
- npm install
- npm run dev

F. Start the API
- cd python_wrapper
- uvicorn api:app --reload

4. Initial Setup & Configuration
- Access the dashboard at http://localhost:5173
- Log in or create an admin user (if prompted)
- Configure your home layout and device mapping via the dashboard or by editing python_wrapper/device_mapping.json
- Validate mapping using the dashboard or API

5. Device Onboarding & Integration

Supported Hubs/Peripherals:
- Raspberry Pi 4/5 (HDMI out, USB mic, Wi-Fi/Ethernet)
- Intel NUC or similar mini-PC
- Commercial HDMI streaming/casting boxes (Linux support)
- USB/HDMI audio capture dongles (HDMI-ARC/eARC input)
- Far-field microphone array (hidden in TV bezel/entertainment center)

Setup Steps:
1. Select and install hardware in desired room (hide for discretion).
2. Install Linux OS (Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, or Debian recommended).
3. Connect to TV via HDMI (audio/video out, HDMI-ARC/eARC for audio in if supported).
4. Connect microphone (USB or far-field array).
5. Connect to home network (Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
6. Install required software:
  - Python 3, sounddevice, ffmpeg, pulseaudio
  - For casting: mkchromecast, vlc
7. Secure local processing (VPN, SSH, TLS as needed).
8. Map each hub to a room in the backend (see device_mapping.json).
9. Use dashboard AudioConfigPanel to view and assign endpoints.
10. Test audio/video relay and device mapping in dashboard.
11. Document setup for each hub in notes.txt and User_Guide.txt.

API Endpoints:
- /hdmi-hubs: List HDMI hubs
- /audio-endpoints: List mapped audio endpoints

Dashboard UI:
- AudioConfigPanel: View/select audio devices, mapped endpoints, and assign to rooms.
A. Supported Devices
- Zigbee (via Zigbee2MQTT or compatible hub)
- Kasa (TP-Link)
- Home Assistant-compatible devices

B. Adding Devices
- Use the dashboard’s device onboarding wizard
- For Zigbee: Pair devices using your Zigbee hub, then scan in the dashboard
- For Kasa: Ensure devices are on the same network, then scan/add in dashboard
- For Home Assistant: Use the integration menu to link your Home Assistant instance

C. Device Mapping
- Assign names, locations, and types to each device
- Use Alexa-style names (e.g., “Living Room 1”)

6. AI Training Templates & Usage
A. Creating Scenarios
- Use provided templates in python_wrapper/automation_templates.json
- Example template:
  {
    "name": "Night Light",
    "trigger": "motion_detected",
    "action": "turn_on",
    "device": "Hallway Light"
  }
- Edit or create new templates for custom automations

B. Training the AI
- Use the dashboard’s AI training section
- Upload or edit scenario templates
- Test automations in the dashboard

7. Dashboard & Controls
- Control devices, view status, and manage automations from the dashboard
- Access analytics, system health, and event history
- Monitor Zigbee routers, mesh network status, and device health in the ZigbeeRouters panel
- Use the mapping and automation editors for advanced configuration
- Troubleshoot device connectivity and health issues with proactive alerts and diagnostics

8. Automation & Rules
- Create, edit, and delete automation rules in the dashboard
- Use templates or build custom rules
- Validate and test automations before enabling

9. Backup, Restore, and Updates
- Use the dashboard or API endpoints to create/restore backups
- Upload OTA updates via the dashboard or /ota API
- Regularly back up your configuration and device mapping
- <b>Disclaimer:</b> User data stored on the server is only accessible for backup and restore operations. No direct access or browsing of user files on the server is permitted. All other data is stored locally or in user-owned cloud storage. This policy is enforced to protect server security and user privacy.

10. Troubleshooting & Support
- Check the dashboard’s diagnostics section for errors
- Use the /diagnostics API for logs and health checks
- View device health and alerts in the Device Health panel
- For support, use the dashboard’s support section:
  - Submit support tickets (with escalation for urgent issues)
  - Access live chat for real-time help (if enabled)
  - Use remote diagnostics for advanced troubleshooting (with user consent)
  - Track ticket status and resolution history
