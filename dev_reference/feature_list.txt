## AI Templates (see ai/template_library.json for details)


## Notes

## Password Policy

- All temporary passwords (for all users, roles, groups, sub-groups, and admins, across all membership tiers) must be reset by the user upon first successful login.
- System will enforce a password reset workflow immediately after initial access with a temporary password.
- Applies to:
	- Admins
	- Admin roles
	- Groups
	- Sub-groups
	- Standard users
- This policy ensures account security and compliance for all access levels.

**Note:** All support staff, in all roles (including Admin), can establish temporary passwords for users to gain full access to their respective accounts, but only after verifying account status and existence in the system.

**Two-Factor Verification for Temporary Passwords:**
- If a request for a temporary password is made, two-factor verification is required before issuance.
	- SMS/Text: A randomly generated six-digit code will be sent to the registered phone number. The user must enter this code to verify.
	- Email: A verification link will be sent to the registered email address. The user must click the link to verify.
- Both SMS/Text and Email verification must be completed before a temporary password can be issued.
- This policy applies system-wide and will be integrated into all user, admin, and support workflows.



Absolutely! Here’s a focused sounding board for “Advanced mapping & editor (beyond basic controls)”—with your current architecture and feature list in mind:

1. What “Advanced” Should Mean Here

Not just static site info, but interactive mapping: drag/drop devices, zone drawing, live device status overlays.
Editable floor plans (upload, draw, or auto-generate from device placement).
Device grouping (zones/rooms), custom labels, and visual tier enforcement (e.g., “add more devices” disabled if tier limit reached).
Real-time feedback: device online/offline, battery, last event, etc.
2. User Roles & Permissions

System admin: Full edit (add/remove devices, zones, upload floor plan, set allowed IPs, etc.).
User admin: View, maybe limited edit (move devices, rename zones).
Remote agent/guest: View only, possibly with annotation/comment ability.
3. UI/UX Considerations

Canvas-based editor (SVG, HTML5 Canvas, or a JS library like Konva.js or Fabric.js).
Device palette: drag new devices onto the map, auto-assigns to nearest zone.
Context menus: right-click to edit device, zone, or remove.
Undo/redo, save draft, and publish changes (with backend sync).
4. Backend/Contract Implications

MappingInfo model expands: zones, device positions, floor plan image, device metadata.
Endpoints for: get/save map, add/remove/move device, upload floor plan, manage zones.
Versioning: keep map history for rollback/audit.
5. Tier Enforcement

Device/zone limits enforced visually and in backend.
“Upgrade to add more” prompts if tier exceeded.
6. Accessibility

Keyboard navigation, screen reader support for map elements.
High-contrast mode, large labels, and tooltips.
7. Future-Proofing

Support for multi-floor/complex sites (even if not enabled for most users).
Hooks for automation: e.g., “if device in zone X triggers, do Y.”
Questions to Consider:

Do you want to support floor plan uploads, or only manual drawing?
Should device placement be “live” (reflecting real device status/position) or just a planning tool?
How much should regular users be able to edit, versus just view?
Is audit/history of map changes important for compliance/support?
Let me know which directions resonate, or if you want a concrete technical plan for any of these!

There is little direct content from the legal sources fetched, but here’s a summary of key liability exposures for home automation, remote monitoring, and AI-driven smart home systems based on legal best practices and industry knowledge:

1. Privacy & Data Security

Collecting, storing, or transmitting user data (especially video/audio) exposes you to privacy law risks (GDPR, CCPA, state/federal wiretap laws).
Breaches or unauthorized access can result in liability for damages, regulatory fines, and lawsuits.
Best practice: Encrypt all sensitive data, provide clear privacy policies, and allow users to control their data.
2. Surveillance & Consent

Recording or monitoring users (especially in private spaces) without explicit, informed consent can lead to civil and criminal liability.
Remote support and live feeds must be opt-in, with audit trails and user/admin controls.
3. Accessibility

Failure to provide accessible interfaces (ADA, WCAG compliance) can result in discrimination claims or regulatory action.
All features should be usable by people with disabilities.
4. Emergency Response

Marketing or implying your system provides life/safety monitoring (e.g., fall detection, emergency escalation) may create a duty of care.
Failure to perform as advertised (missed alerts, system downtime) can result in negligence claims.
5. Product Liability

Defects in hardware/software that cause property damage, injury, or loss may expose you to strict liability or negligence claims.
Regular updates, clear disclaimers, and robust QA/testing are essential.
6. Third-Party Integrations

Liability can extend to failures in third-party devices/services you integrate with (e.g., Home Assistant, Zigbee, Kasa).
Contracts and user agreements should clarify limits of responsibility.
7. User Agreements & Disclaimers

Well-drafted terms of service, privacy policies, and disclaimers are critical to limit liability.
Users should acknowledge risks, limits of monitoring, and their own responsibilities.
8. Security Vulnerabilities

Unpatched vulnerabilities can be exploited, leading to data loss, privacy breaches, or physical harm.
Ongoing security audits 453>..

User: Great Job! thank you, I was losing my mind.. lol

GitHub Copilot: You're welcome! If you need more features, debugging, or future expansions, just let me know—I'm here to help.

User: I'm thinking we will need and images.jpeg file in here for stock images

GitHub Copilot: Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/brent/Desktop/Supplimental/Core%20Website_mappedhome.com/frontend/images.jpeg)

A placeholder images.jpeg file has been added to the frontend directory. Replace it with your actual stock images as needed. If you want to add or organize more images, let me know!

Made changes.

User: Globally, I want a light leather tan backgound on all of the pages, for now if possible textured

```

```
A seamless light leather tan texture background has been added to all pages. The style is now globally applied—refresh your browser to see the effect. If you want a different texture or further adjustments, just let me know!

Made changes.

User: now, how should I section this out and what content do you suggest here (don't do anything, just comment)

GitHub Copilot: For a modern landing page, consider these sections:

1. **Hero Section**: Eye-catching headline, subheading, and a call-to-action (CTA) button (e.g., “Get Started” or “Join Now”). Add a relevant image or illustration.

2. **Features/Benefits**: Briefly highlight 3–4 key features or benefits of your membership/service, each with an icon or small image.

3. **How It Works**: Simple 3-step process (e.g., Sign Up → Choose Tier → Get Started).

4. **Testimonials**: Short quotes from users or placeholders for future testimonials.

5. **Call to Action**: Another CTA, such as “Sign Up Free” or “See Membership Tiers.”

6. **Footer**: Contact info, social links, copyright, and navigation.

You can use semantic HTML5 elements like `<section>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for structure. Each section should be visually distinct, with clear headings and concise content.

User: what do you think

GitHub Copilot: Your approach is solid! Using clear sections (hero, features, how it works, testimonials, CTA, footer) will make the landing page engaging and easy to navigate. This structure is proven to convert visitors and guide them through your value proposition. With your leather background and navigation, it will look professional and inviting. If you want to refine content or add interactive elements, just ask!

User: okay, so do me a favor here

GitHub Copilot: Of course! Please let me know what specific favor or change you’d like me to make to your landing page or project, and I’ll take care of it.

User: create a notes.txt file, document everyting we have done, including seperation of the modules and exporting them out of the project for later implimentation.  document that we are using existing work in modularly, but building the project in natural steps, to refine and be more managable.  also document that we are starting out with the basics front end schema and working from the front to the back end, as we are building out this project, due to previous issues with a larger build out. 

GitHub Copilot: Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/brent/Desktop/Supplimental/Core%20Website_mappedhome.com/notes.txt)

A notes.txt file has been created, documenting the modular structure, development approach, and rationale for building the project step by step from frontend to backend. This will help guide future work and clarify the project's evolution. If you need more details or updates, just let me know!
