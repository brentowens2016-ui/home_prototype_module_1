Module: Predictive AI and Regenerative Learning (Module 2)

Precise Description:
This module encapsulates all predictive, regenerative, and adaptive AI logic for the Home Prototype system. It provides:
- REST endpoints for predictive lighting and automation, enabling event-driven and scenario-based control of smart devices.
- CLI tools for scenario/event input, training, and event chain diagnostics, supporting continuous learning and system adaptation.
- All utilities for scenario management, event chain analysis, and adaptive automation, ensuring the system can learn from user behavior and environmental data.
This module is designed for independent development, testing, and extension of all AI-driven features, and is the only module permitted to directly access or modify scenario/event training data.

Integration: FastAPI router, REST endpoints, dashboard integration, standalone CLI tools for training and diagnostics.

AI Module Dependencies (for full self-contained development):
- predictive_ai.py (core AI logic, event-driven automation)
- scenario_input.py (scenario/event input, training utilities)
- event_chain_manager.py (event chain management, diagnostics)
- event_template.json (AI scenario/event input template)
- Any additional shared utilities imported by the above (see below)

Dependency Audit (import tree):
* predictive_ai.py imports:
    - os, json, time, random, logging (standard library)
    - event_template.json (data file)
    - scenario_input.py (for scenario input/training)
    - event_chain_manager.py (for event chain management)
    - No other custom modules detected
* scenario_input.py imports:
    - os, json, sys, argparse (standard library)
    - event_template.json (data file)
    - predictive_ai.py (for AI logic)
    - No other custom modules detected
* event_chain_manager.py imports:
    - os, json, sys, argparse (standard library)
    - predictive_ai.py (for AI logic)
    - scenario_input.py (for scenario input)
    - event_template.json (data file)
    - No other custom modules detected

All AI logic and dependencies are now referenced here. If you add new AI utilities, update this list and ensure they are included in the module's documentation.
