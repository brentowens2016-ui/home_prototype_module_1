Brainstorming: Pressure Sensors & Integration

- Exploring pressure sensors for beds, chairs, and position detection throughout the household.
- Considering integration options:
  - rppal (Raspberry Pi GPIO library)
  - MQTT for messaging and device state updates
  - Home Assistant integration for automation and dashboard control
  - Zigbee pressure strips, Zigbee routers, Zigbee coordinators
  - Establishing a Zigbee mesh network for sensors (connected in parallel)
- Planning to monitor sensor states on the desktop/control dashboard.
- Hardware not yet purchased; ideas may be prototyped in software ahead of hardware acquisition.
- May require microprocessors/relays for pressure switches.
- Will document further research and integration strategies here as ideas develop.

Connection & Testing Guide: Zigbee/Sensor Hardware

1. Use USB Zigbee coordinators (CC2531, ConBee II, Sonoff Zigbee dongle) for plug-and-play connection to your computer.
2. Run Zigbee coordinator software (zigpy, zigbee2mqtt, etc.) inside a Docker container or virtual machine for isolation and safety.
3. Connect Zigbee routers and sensors to the mesh network via the coordinator; monitor/control them through the backend and dashboard.
4. For safe packaging and removability:
   - Use USB extension cables or powered hubs for easy access and quick removal.
   - Document all hardware connections and software dependencies here for future reference.
   - Unplug USB devices when not in use; stop Docker containers/VMs to disconnect software access.
   - Avoid running as administrator/root unless required by hardware drivers.
5. For testing:
   - Start the Docker container/VM with Zigbee software.
   - Plug in the coordinator and verify device detection.
   - Pair Zigbee routers/sensors and confirm network formation.
   - Use backend API and dashboard to monitor device status.

Best practices:
- Keep hardware removable and software isolated to minimize risk to your computer.
- Always document changes and configurations in notes.txt.
- Unplug and power down hardware when not actively testing.

Brainstorming: Zigbee Router Monitoring & Equipment

- Goal: Monitor Zigbee routers and mesh network status in Dashboard.
- Backend: Plan to use zigpy, bellows, or zigbee2mqtt for Zigbee communication in Python.
- UI: Dashboard will have a ZigbeeRouters.jsx component to display router/network status.
- REST API: Will expose router/sensor status via new endpoints in python_wrapper/api.py.

Equipment suggestions:
- Zigbee Coordinator: CC2531 USB dongle, ConBee II, or Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle Plus
- Zigbee Routers: IKEA Tradfri repeater, Sonoff Zigbee plug, or any Zigbee-certified router device
- Sensors: Aqara pressure strips, Tuya Zigbee pressure sensors
- Raspberry Pi (for running coordinator software)

Implementation will begin after hardware acquisition. All ideas and plans documented for future reference.

Zigbee Router Device Capacity

- One Zigbee router can typically support 10–15 pressure strips (Zigbee end devices) within its signal range.
- Zigbee mesh networks are designed to handle dozens of end devices per router, depending on hardware and firmware.
- For best reliability, ensure all strips are within the router’s range and test for connectivity issues.
- If dropped connections or delays occur, add a second router to improve network stability.
- Regularly test and monitor network performance as more devices are added.

Zigbee Router Placement Suggestions

- Place routers in central locations to maximize coverage (e.g., hallways, living rooms).
- Avoid placing routers near large metal objects, microwaves, or Wi-Fi routers to reduce interference.
- If possible, position routers on different floors to extend coverage vertically.
- For large homes, place routers so that each sensor/strip is within range of at least one router or the coordinator.
- Test signal strength and reliability after initial placement; move routers as needed to eliminate dead zones.
- Consider outlets near pressure strips or areas with multiple sensors for convenient power and coverage.

Best practice: Start with minimal routers, test, and add more only if needed.

Testing & Calibration Plan

- Initial testing will use only a few pressure strips for individual calibration.
- Each strip will be calibrated to respond to the system when its circuit is closed.
- Expansion to more strips and sensors will be implemented as resources allow.
- Calibration data and response logic will be documented for each strip to ensure reliable integration.
- System will be designed for easy addition of new strips/sensors in the future.

Entryway Coverage Calculation & Router Placement

- Entryway dimensions: 30 ft long x 8 ft wide
- Pressure strips spaced every 2–3 ft (centered in pathway):
  - 2 ft intervals: 15 strips
  - 3 ft intervals: 10 strips
- Strips can be placed at key transition points (e.g., near breakfast bar, kitchen/dining entry).

Zigbee Router Placement:
- Zigbee routers typically cover 10–20 meters (33–66 ft) indoors, but walls/interference may reduce range.
- One router placed on the breakfast bar (25 ft from front door) should cover the entryway strips, assuming minimal obstructions.
- If signal is weak or unreliable, add a second router midway down the entryway for redundancy.
- Test signal strength after initial placement and adjust as needed.

Best practice: Start with one router on the breakfast bar, expand only if coverage issues arise.

Project Scope & Modularity

- This system is for beta testing various devices and configurations; it will not be permanently installed in the home.
- All hardware and software components will be packaged for easy removal and future expansion.
- The project is being built in modules to allow flexible upgrades and integration of new devices as needed.
- Documentation and organization will support rapid deployment and reconfiguration for future phases.




01/278/26 7:34PM    Notes:
I am thinking that this project needs a mapping engine:
reasoning:  placement and tracking of foot-falls, falls of people, needs to be pin-pointed.
I think the engine config. should include incrimental room sized, overall home/apt/sizes incrimental sized, in set up of specific account.
modular room placement, or the ability to design interior walls and barriers, walk-ways, living areas should be known to the dashboard
display location of specific sensor's location, and track movement over sensors.

idea:  refer to mapping engine of Irobot, the home sweeper?  Walls are moveable, then area lines can be drawn after the robot maps 
floor plan.  But since no robot to do the mapping, then the abilty to size the room and place it in perspective position, as defined by 
the user, at setup of the program in terminal.

Engine should be able to be editable, within the dashboard, by the user.
Logic behind this, is that people sometimes add rooms, add living spaces, some homes/apts, and other dwellings are multiple story
homes, so  the ability to indicate and map additional floors, within the home, should be considered included in this engine.

Flow of setup (Suggested):
primary ground floor and optional other floors should be able to be selected by user.  Each floor of the home, should be sized and 
drawn in the map, according to modular placement, within the map.

Stairs and elevators should be optional additions, additions to show bathrooms, closets, and other room spaces should be considered.

let user select number of floors, number of bathrooms, number of closets, number of regular rooms and master bedroom with master bathroom.

let user use a questionaire, to select what elements should be populated in the map.  sizes should be individualized to each space and walking paths (hallways).
then give user a slider, to indicate room size (range from 10 sq feet to  120 sq feet for homes under 1000 square feet total house living space, for smaller to medium sized homes)
give user user a slider for a home that has a range of 1000 square feet to 2000 square feet of total living space.
give user a slider for a home that is over 2000 square feet to 5000 square feet of total living space.

Room modules should allow for the user to create each room space, closet spaces, and bathrooms, to scale with a maximum size of the total home 
sqare footage declared in selection of home square footage.  each scale should not exceed 1/3rd of total living square footage.

room dividers should be linear, lines that work on an axis that can rotate, to acccomodate straight line borders for each room, walk space,
closet, bathrooms, pantries, wash rooms, service rooms, etc...

User, during set-up will set up location (exact address, apartment/unit number (if applicable), city, state, and zip),
User during set up will set up a phone number for the home/user, and all family members, friends, and emergency contacts, which will
be notified if a safety issue (falls, intrusion, other personal issues) are detected by the system, via tty/voice/text messaging.
User will have to set up local Emergency Services phone numbers, and preference to set up 911 contact if system esculates to an emergency.
this should be done during setup.

I am thinking that during set up, this mapping should be done, by the user.

I am thinking that this mapping engine should be done using Python part of this program, which also should be the primary monitoring, using Rust for dynmaic
services, maybe the call-out services. 

The map engine, and the final display of home footprint, should be displayed on the dashboard, with user controls. placement is optional.
