TODO: User Agreement – Subscription Coverage Clarification

---

TODO: Commercial Signup, Inquiry, and Scheduling Workflow

---

NOTES: Scalability, Liability, SLAs, and User/Admin Roles

- Liability insurance and/or bonding will be required for both residential and commercial deployments. Blanket coverage should be explored.
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs): Will need to be parsed into specific topics for future discussion and drafting.
- Each location (home or commercial site) will be a separate subscription; user groups are confined to the household/facility and their emergency contacts.
- Family members can have read/monitor-only roles until upgraded by support or an admin.
- Maintenance staff for commercial sites will be assigned as site-level admins (not backend/system-wide admins).
- Two types of admin roles:
  - Site Authorized Admin: Admin privileges for a specific site/location (multiple people possible).
  - System/Backend Admin: Higher-level admin for backend/server management (restricted access).
- Similar admin/monitor role structure should be implemented for household subscriptions (e.g., Mom/Dad/Adults as admins, others as monitor-only users).

- On website/signup, require user to select Home Use or Commercial Use.
- If Commercial Use:
  - Redirect to a detailed inquiry form (facility type, location, square footage, rooms, requirements, contact info).
  - Inform user that a custom quote will be provided.
  - Offer a scheduling tool for consultation/site survey (calendar picker or callback request).
  - Send confirmation/reminders to both client and team.
- If Home Use:
  - Proceed with standard checkout and subscription pricing.
- Make pricing transparency clear: commercial installs require site-specific quote due to complexity and support needs.

- Clearly state in the user agreement that subscription fees only cover access to the software/service and standard support.
- Hardware, installation, interfaces, wiring, electrical or plumbing work, and custom programming for new features or hardware are NOT included in the subscription and may require separate agreements or fees.
- Example language: "Subscription fees cover access to the software platform and standard support only. Hardware, installation, interfaces, wiring, electrical or plumbing work, and custom programming for new features or hardware are not included and may require separate agreements or fees."

- Document options for integrating affiliate links into the dashboard, website, or user documentation.
- Evaluate potential revenue and compliance requirements for affiliate marketing in the smart home context.
---

TODO: Modular AI Training & Suggestion Interfaces

- Design modular AI training and suggestion features:
  - User module: Everyday feedback, suggestions, and interactions (text/audio), no technical controls.
  - Admin/technician module: Advanced training, diagnostics, technical suggestions, logs, and configuration.
- Ensure only authorized users (admins/technicians) can access technical features.
- Both modules active for admins; only user module visible for regular users.
- Security: Prevent unauthorized access to system-level controls and technical details.
---

TODO: Privacy Acceptance Dialog

- Implement an accept/decline dialog during setup/installation that presents clear, boilerplate privacy and data use disclosures.
- Disclosure should state:
  - What data is collected and how it is used
  - Data is not currently sold or used for other purposes, but this may change to comply with laws, user agreements, or privacy policies
  - Reference to privacy policy and user agreement, with links or access to full text
  - Explicit acceptance required to proceed; decline exits or disables setup
- Example language:
  "By clicking Accept, you acknowledge that you have read and understood our Privacy Policy and User Agreement. Your data is not currently sold or used for any other purposes, but this may change as required by law or policy updates. You will be notified of any changes and may review our policies at any time."

Must be implemented before beta or public release.

TODO: AI Assistant Tone, Learning, and Customization

- Assistant Tone: Ensure all spoken responses are calm, clear, and reassuring—no unnecessary fluff or overly casual language. Prioritize trust and clarity, especially for urgent or sensitive events.
- Standard Library: Develop a well-crafted set of default phrases and responses (core vocabulary) for all common events, commands, and clarifications.
- Learning & Expansion: Enable the AI to expand its vocabulary and phrasing over time, learning from user interactions and preferences, but always within boundaries of clarity and appropriateness.
- Contextual Integrity: System should understand context (who, where, when, what’s happening) and tailor responses accordingly—different tones or levels of detail for emergencies vs. routine events.
- Customizability: Allow users and families to adjust the assistant’s style, vocabulary, and which types of questions or notifications they want to receive.
- Benefits: Users feel respected and in control; system adapts to different households and personalities; communication is always clear, never overwhelming or confusing.

Next steps: Structure the standard library, design customization and learning features, and plan user management of these options.

Connection & Testing Guide: Zigbee/Sensor Hardware

1. Use USB Zigbee coordinators (CC2531, ConBee II, Sonoff Zigbee dongle) for plug-and-play connection to your computer.
2. Run Zigbee coordinator software (zigpy, zigbee2mqtt, etc.) inside a Docker container or virtual machine for isolation and safety.
3. Connect Zigbee routers and sensors to the mesh network via the coordinator; monitor/control them through the backend and dashboard.
4. For safe packaging and removability:
   - Use USB extension cables or powered hubs for easy access and quick removal.
   - Document all hardware connections and software dependencies here for future reference.
   - Unplug USB devices when not in use; stop Docker containers/VMs to disconnect software access.
   - Avoid running as administrator/root unless required by hardware drivers.
5. For testing:
   - Start the Docker container/VM with Zigbee software.
   - Plug in the coordinator and verify device detection.
   - Pair Zigbee routers/sensors and confirm network formation.
   - Use backend API and dashboard to monitor device status.

Best practices:
- Keep hardware removable and software isolated to minimize risk to your computer.
- Always document changes and configurations in notes.txt.
- Unplug and power down hardware when not actively testing.

Brainstorming: Zigbee Router Monitoring & Equipment

- Goal: Monitor Zigbee routers and mesh network status in Dashboard.
- Backend: Plan to use zigpy, bellows, or zigbee2mqtt for Zigbee communication in Python.
- UI: Dashboard will have a ZigbeeRouters.jsx component to display router/network status.
- REST API: Will expose router/sensor status via new endpoints in python_wrapper/api.py.

Equipment suggestions:
- Zigbee Coordinator: CC2531 USB dongle, ConBee II, or Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle Plus
- Zigbee Routers: IKEA Tradfri repeater, Sonoff Zigbee plug, or any Zigbee-certified router device
- Sensors: Aqara pressure strips, Tuya Zigbee pressure sensors
- Raspberry Pi (for running coordinator software)

Implementation will begin after hardware acquisition. All ideas and plans documented for future reference.

[2026-01-27]
Zigbee Router Device Capacity

- One Zigbee router can typically support 10–15 pressure strips (Zigbee end devices) within its signal range.
- Zigbee mesh networks are designed to handle dozens of end devices per router, depending on hardware and firmware.
- For best reliability, ensure all strips are within the router’s range and test for connectivity issues.
- If dropped connections or delays occur, add a second router to improve network stability.
- Regularly test and monitor network performance as more devices are added.

---

[2026-01-27]
Zigbee Router Placement Suggestions

- Place routers in central locations to maximize coverage (e.g., hallways, living rooms).
- Avoid placing routers near large metal objects, microwaves, or Wi-Fi routers to reduce interference.
- If possible, position routers on different floors to extend coverage vertically.
- For large homes, place routers so that each sensor/strip is within range of at least one router or the coordinator.
- Test signal strength and reliability after initial placement; move routers as needed to eliminate dead zones.
- Consider outlets near pressure strips or areas with multiple sensors for convenient power and coverage.

Best practice: Start with minimal routers, test, and add more only if needed.

---

[2026-01-27]
Testing & Calibration Plan

- Initial testing will use only a few pressure strips for individual calibration.
- Each strip will be calibrated to respond to the system when its circuit is closed.
- Expansion to more strips and sensors will be implemented as resources allow.
- Calibration data and response logic will be documented for each strip to ensure reliable integration.
- System will be designed for easy addition of new strips/sensors in the future.

---

[2026-01-27]
Entryway Coverage Calculation & Router Placement

- Entryway dimensions: 30 ft long x 8 ft wide
- Pressure strips spaced every 2–3 ft (centered in pathway):
  - 2 ft intervals: 15 strips
  - 3 ft intervals: 10 strips
- Strips can be placed at key transition points (e.g., near breakfast bar, kitchen/dining entry).

Zigbee Router Placement:
- Zigbee routers typically cover 10–20 meters (33–66 ft) indoors, but walls/interference may reduce range.
- One router placed on the breakfast bar (25 ft from front door) should cover the entryway strips, assuming minimal obstructions.
- If signal is weak or unreliable, add a second router midway down the entryway for redundancy.
- Test signal strength after initial placement and adjust as needed.

Best practice: Start with one router on the breakfast bar, expand only if coverage issues arise.
