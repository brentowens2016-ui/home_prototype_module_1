## Update: February 1, 2026 (AI Model Requirements & Learning)

- The AI model is global, adaptive, and available to all users, but its capabilities are limited by membership tier.
- AI must discover and map new devices, learn user routines, and create predictive automations.
- AI suggestions: The system should proactively suggest routines, device integrations, and optimizations as it learns from user behavior.
- Training templates: Users will have access to templates (e.g., "Morning Routine", "Away Mode") to help train the AI for their environment.
- User feedback loop: Users can accept, reject, or modify AI suggestions, further refining the model.
- Templates and training tools will be included in the local agent for offline personalization.
- System admins must approve any AI-driven changes that write to the backend/mainframe.
- AI must always respect tier boundaries and never enable features outside the user’s allowed level.
- The AI will poll the backend for membership status and updates, supporting continuous improvement and rolling feature releases.

Next: Begin building out the AI model and integrate it into the project architecture.

## Update: February 1, 2026 (Membership Tiers & Access Control)

- Membership is organized into three main tiers: Basic, Advanced, and Unlimited/Pro.
- Sub-tiers exist under main member accounts: Guests, Emergency Contacts, Services (e.g., caregivers, maintenance), and Family Members.
- Main tier determines which dashboard features/tabs are available to the user.
- Sub-tiers inherit access from the main member but may have further restrictions (e.g., guests may only view, emergency contacts may only receive alerts).
- Tabs and controls in the dashboard are shown, hidden, or locked based on the user’s tier and sub-tier role.
- This structure supports clear, scalable access control and can be expanded as new features or roles are added.

Next: Map features to tiers/sub-tiers and implement access logic in contracts and UI as features are developed.
# Project Notes: mappedhome.com Membership Website
# Last updated: January 31, 2026

## Overview
This project is a modular, multi-page membership website with a FastAPI backend (Python, Rust FFI) and a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend. The project is being built in natural, incremental steps to ensure manageability and clarity, especially after previous issues with larger, monolithic build-outs.

## Current Structure
- **frontend/**: Contains all static HTML, CSS, JS, and image assets for the user interface.
- **backend/**: FastAPI application with endpoints for signup, login, tier selection, onboarding, and dashboard download. Python code is kept modular for easy expansion.
- **rust_agent/**: Rust library compiled as a Python extension (using PyO3) for agent logic, designed to be imported into the backend as needed.
- **.github/**: Contains copilot-instructions.md for workspace-specific automation and documentation.

## Modular Approach
- Each major component (frontend, backend, Rust agent) is separated into its own directory.
- Components are designed to be exported or reused in other projects if needed.
- The backend and Rust agent are loosely coupled, with FFI integration points clearly marked for future expansion.
- The frontend is static and can be served by any web server or CDN.

## Development Process
- We are starting with a basic frontend schema (HTML/CSS/JS) to establish the user experience and navigation.
- Backend endpoints are being added incrementally, with placeholder logic and clear TODOs for Rust FFI integration.
- The Rust agent is scaffolded and compiled, ready for future logic implementation and integration.
- This stepwise approach allows for easier debugging, testing, and refinement at each stage.

## Rationale
- Previous attempts at a large, all-at-once build led to complexity and management issues.
- By building from the frontend to the backend, we ensure the user experience is prioritized and the API is tailored to real UI needs.
- Modularization allows for easier maintenance, testing, and future feature expansion.

## Next Steps

## Update: January 31, 2026 (Later Session)

- Initialized a new git repository in the project root and removed a conflicting .git directory in the backend.
- Staged and committed all project files with a descriptive initial commit message.
- Added the remote GitHub repository (https://github.com/brentowens2016-ui/home_prototype_module_1.git) as origin.
- Renamed the default branch to main for GitHub compatibility.
- Pushed the initial commit to the remote repository.
- Pulled the latest changes on the server, confirming the project is now up to date and synchronized.
- Server is on stand-by until further development or deployment is needed.

All work is now versioned and safely stored on GitHub. Ready to resume or expand as needed.
- Continue refining frontend pages and navigation.
- Gradually implement backend logic and connect to Rust agent as needed.
- Expand documentation and modular exports as the project grows.

## Update: February 1, 2026 (Dashboard & Agent Discussion)

- Dashboard will use a layered, tabbed structure. Tabs correspond to features subscribed by the user; inaccessible tabs are visible but locked to encourage upgrades.
- Each tab contains modular controls (sidebar for on/off, panel-level toggles) and only displays outputs for active features.
- The dashboard is the main interface for remote agent access, but members are encouraged to use a downloadable agent running locally.
- The local agent operates independently, periodically syncing with the server for updates and status. It can automatically log in for "call-out" features (alerts, notifications) without manual user login.
- Online dashboard access is restricted to authenticated members only; casual visitors cannot access it.
- The system is designed for flexibility: users can choose "always-on" dashboard access or rely on the local agent, with seamless transitions and clear status indicators.

## Update: February 1, 2026 (Contract & Dashboard Integration)

- Created cross-platform contract structures for dashboard features in Python (backend/contracts.py), TypeScript (frontend/contracts.ts), and Rust (rust_agent/src/contracts.rs).
- Integrated contract structure into dashboard.js for consistent data handling and smooth user experience.
- Updated dashboard to fetch contract data from backend endpoint, supporting future contract updates and feature expansion.
- Ensured all navigation and styles are consistent across frontend pages.
- Backend server is running and serving dashboard data for frontend integration.

Next: Continue refining contracts and dashboard logic as features are added or updated.
