# Project Notes: mappedhome.com Membership Website
# Last updated: January 31, 2026

## Overview
This project is a modular, multi-page membership website with a FastAPI backend (Python, Rust FFI) and a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend. The project is being built in natural, incremental steps to ensure manageability and clarity, especially after previous issues with larger, monolithic build-outs.

## Current Structure
- **frontend/**: Contains all static HTML, CSS, JS, and image assets for the user interface.
- **backend/**: FastAPI application with endpoints for signup, login, tier selection, onboarding, and dashboard download. Python code is kept modular for easy expansion.
- **rust_agent/**: Rust library compiled as a Python extension (using PyO3) for agent logic, designed to be imported into the backend as needed.
- **.github/**: Contains copilot-instructions.md for workspace-specific automation and documentation.

## Modular Approach
- Each major component (frontend, backend, Rust agent) is separated into its own directory.
- Components are designed to be exported or reused in other projects if needed.
- The backend and Rust agent are loosely coupled, with FFI integration points clearly marked for future expansion.
- The frontend is static and can be served by any web server or CDN.

## Development Process
- We are starting with a basic frontend schema (HTML/CSS/JS) to establish the user experience and navigation.
- Backend endpoints are being added incrementally, with placeholder logic and clear TODOs for Rust FFI integration.
- The Rust agent is scaffolded and compiled, ready for future logic implementation and integration.
- This stepwise approach allows for easier debugging, testing, and refinement at each stage.

## Rationale
- Previous attempts at a large, all-at-once build led to complexity and management issues.
- By building from the frontend to the backend, we ensure the user experience is prioritized and the API is tailored to real UI needs.
- Modularization allows for easier maintenance, testing, and future feature expansion.

## Next Steps
- Continue refining frontend pages and navigation.
- Gradually implement backend logic and connect to Rust agent as needed.
- Expand documentation and modular exports as the project grows.
